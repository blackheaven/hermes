# 2. Express features using Gherkin

Date: 2019-06-09

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We want to have a clear goal and to stick to it.

## Decision

We will use Gherkin syntax and [Ruby's Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/) for each new feature.

Features will be stored as features/xx-some-title.feature.

## Consequences

Each new feature will begin by writing a feature file, once runnable the unit tests then implementation code should be written.
